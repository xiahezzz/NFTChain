// A ProposalResponse is returned from an endorser to the proposal submitter.

// request of a client to perform an action over a chaincode (or more
// generically on the ledger); the response might be success/error (conveyed in
// the Response field) together with a description of the action and a
// signature over it by that endorser.  If a sufficient number of distinct
// endorsers agree on the same action and produce signature to that effect, a
// transaction can be generated and sent for ordering.

// A response with a representation similar to an HTTP response that can
// be used within another message.
